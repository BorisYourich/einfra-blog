We are a unique e-infrastructure for research and development in the Czech Republic, which represents a transparent environment providing complex capacities and resources for the transmission, storage and processing of scientific data to all entities engaged in research and development, regardless of which industry they work within. As such, it constitutes a communication, information, storage and computing platform for research and development at the national and international levels and provides an extensive and comprehensive portfolio of ICT services, without which modern research and development cannot be realised.
