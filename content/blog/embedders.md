# Embedders
In this article, we learned about how we implemented embedders to improve chatbots over our. This one describes our next steps.

We furhter experimented with more embedding models, as there is a lot of different ones. 
We wanted to see, which model fits our purposes the best:
process the Markdown documentation in a way so that the chatbot is provided with the most relevant documents possible, 
In consequence, the chatbot helps the user solving the issue.

For example, when typing "xyz" to the chatbot, the embedder should say "Use these documents to answer." 
and provide the chatbot with e. g. 5 documents (Omero.dmx, Kubectl.mdx,...)

## How do these embedders differ?
