# Introducing CERIT-SC AI Tools: Smart, Secure, and Ready for Research

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept‚Äîit's now a cornerstone of modern scientific research. At **CERIT-SC**, we are proud to announce a new suite of AI services designed specifically for the academic community. These tools are **powerful**, **user-friendly**, and most importantly, **securely hosted within the trusted e-INFRA CZ infrastructure**.

## Meet the Open WebUI Platform

At the heart of our AI offering is the **Open WebUI platform**‚Äîa secure, on-premise interface providing access to advanced language models for a variety of tasks, including:

- Natural language chatting  
- Code generation and assistance  
- Document analysis  
- Image generation

The interface is intuitive and supports multiple languages, including **Czech**. Whether you're a researcher looking to analyze complex documents or a developer integrating AI into your workflows, Open WebUI is ready for you.

### Dedicated WebUI Clones for Institutions

We are also able to deploy **dedicated instances (clones) of our WebUI** for specific user groups and institutions. This ensures even more control over usage, configuration, and access.  
üìå **Charles University** is one of the first institutions currently benefiting from this customized deployment.


## Built for Developers and Power Users

Behind the sleek interface lies a set of **robust, REST-based APIs**‚Äîfully documented and **OpenAI-compatible**‚Äîthat make it easy to connect your own applications or scripts. This flexibility empowers you to build, experiment, and deploy AI-assisted workflows that fit your research goals.


## Models That Match Your Needs

We provide both a **stable set of language models** (like **LLaMA 3.3**) and an **experimental track** where new models are tested and evaluated. If your research team has specific requirements, we‚Äôre open to including additional models based on relevance and demand. Just let us know!

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Open WebUI**: Chat interface similar to popular AI tools  
- **Combined web and arXiv search**: Get AI-enhanced answers from online and academic sources  
- **Image generation**: Create visual content with text prompts  
- **Document RAG**: Upload your own PDFs and ask questions based on their content  
- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Seamless integration with your custom apps  
- **Secure access**: Requires a valid MetaCenter account  

## Why Choose Our AI Services?

While commercial AI platforms are fast and convenient, they often raise serious questions around **data privacy** and **vendor lock-in**. In contrast, our AI tools:

- Run **entirely on-premise** within the secure e-INFRA CZ infrastructure  
- **Never share your data** with third-party services  
- Offer **transparent operations**, governed by the Czech academic community

## Integrated with Your Research Environment

Our AI tools are fully integrated into the platforms many researchers already use:

- **JupyterHub**: With the *Notebook Intelligence* extension, you can use in-house AI models like *Command-A* directly in your notebooks. Prefer something else? Easily switch using your own API keys.  
- **RStudio**: Thanks to the *gpt-studio* extension, AI assistance is also available in your favorite data science environment.

üöÄ Access it here: [hub.cloud.e-infra.cz](https://hub.cloud.e-infra.cz/hub/home)

## AI-Powered Documentation

Need help navigating our infrastructure or solving common issues? Visit our updated documentation portal:  
üìö [docs.e-infra.cz](https://docs.e-infra.cz)

It now features an **AI-powered assistant** that can answer questions, suggest solutions, and help you get the most out of our services.

## Optional: Commercial AI Integration

For user groups with specific needs, we offer **prepaid access** to commercial models like OpenAI or Anthropic‚Äîaccessible through the same unified interface.
